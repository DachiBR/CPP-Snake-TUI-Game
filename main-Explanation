The program begins with a standard set of C++ include statements, followed by the main() function. The main() function defines a character array called "name" with space for 20 characters.

  // Initialize ncurses
    initscr();
    start_color();
    init_pair(1, COLOR_GREEN, COLOR_BLACK);
    attron(COLOR_PAIR(1));
The program initializes the ncurses library, which provides a way to interact with the terminal window in a more interactive way. The program sets up a green and black color scheme for the text and enables this color scheme for use in the program.

   // Calculate screen dimensions
    int screen_x, screen_y;
    getmaxyx(stdscr, screen_y, screen_x);
The program determines the size of the terminal window by calling getmaxyx() function, which takes the standard screen (stdscr) and returns the height and width of the terminal in characters.

  // Center the welcome message
    const char* welcome_message = "Welcome to Snake TUI Game!";
    int welcome_message_len = strlen(welcome_message);
    int welcome_message_x = (screen_x - welcome_message_len) / 2;
    int welcome_message_y = screen_y / 2 - 1;
The program centers the welcome message text by calculating its length and position based on the dimensions of the terminal.

 // Center the name prompt message
    const char* name_prompt = "Please enter your name:";
    int name_prompt_len = strlen(name_prompt);
    int name_prompt_x = (screen_x - name_prompt_len) / 2;
    int name_prompt_y = screen_y / 2 + 1;
The program centers the name prompt message text by calculating its length and position based on the dimensions of the terminal.

 // Draw the box and messages
    box(stdscr, 0, 0);
    mvprintw(welcome_message_y, welcome_message_x, "%s", welcome_message);
    mvprintw(name_prompt_y, name_prompt_x, "%s", name_prompt);
The program draws a box around the edges of the terminal window and displays the welcome message and name prompt message in the center of the window.

 // Enable echoing of input and read the player's name
    echo();
    mvgetstr(name_prompt_y + 2, name_prompt_x, name);
The program enables input echoing and uses the ncurses function mvgetstr() to read the user's input into the "name" character array.

// Clear the screen and display the start message
    clear();
    const char* start_message = "Hello, %s! Press any key to start the game...";
    int start_message_len = strlen(start_message) + strlen(name) - 2;
    int start_message_x = (screen_x - start_message_len) / 2;
    int start_message_y = screen_y / 2;
    mvprintw(start_message_y, start_message_x, start_message, name);
    getch(); // wait for a key press
The program clears the terminal window and displays a personalized start message with the user's name and prompting them to press any key to start the game. The player's name is also written to a file named "usernames.txt" using an ofstream object.


Finally, the program turns off the color pair and closes the ncurses window. It then uses the system() function to execute the Snake Game executable file named "snake_game" in the same directory as the program. The function returns 0, indicating that the program has run successfully.

In summary, this code is a simple program that prompts the player to enter their name, saves the name to a file, and launches a Snake Game executable. It uses the ncurses library to create a simple text-based interface for the player.
